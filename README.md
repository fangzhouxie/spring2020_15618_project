We implemented Johnson's Algorithm for all-pairs shortest path from scratch using OpenMP and CUDA. We also measured and analyzed the performance improvements in different parts of the program and on graphs with different number of nodes and different graph densities. Our OpenMP implementation achieved a best speedup of **5.87x** on GHC machines, as shown in Figure 1. Our CUDA implementation achieved a best speedup of **10.11x** on GHC machines, as shown in Figure 2.
